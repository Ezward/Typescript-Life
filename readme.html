            <section id="introduction">
                <p>Conway's Life is not really a game, it is a cellular automata that, to our eye, simulates the evolution of a population.  So there are no 'moves' that are made.  Instead, the board (or the world) is populated, then the rules are applied to create a new population.  This is done over and over again so that the population evolves.  Even though the rules are simple, the result can be amazingly complex and interesting.</p>
                <h4>The rules of Life</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Any live individual with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
                    <li>Any live individual with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
                    <li>Any live individual with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.</li>
                    <li>Any dead individual with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live individual, as if by reproduction.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The fun part is watching as the population evolves; as you watch the world animate you will understand why Conway called this Life.  For a more detailed and visual explanation, see this <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking/lecture/22?s=e" target="_blank">video</a> from the University of Michigan.  If you liked that video, you may want to see the <a href="https://class.coursera.org/modelthinking/lecture/23?s=e" target="_blank">next one</a> in the series which goes into depth on 1D Cellular Automata.  If you are really interested in Cellular Automata, here is an <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cellular-automata/"  target="_blank">entry</a> in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy that talks about 1D Cellular Automata, the Game of Life (2D Cellular Automata) and their signficance to the study of complexity and emergent behavior.

                <h3>The World</h3>
                <p>Life is 'played' on a rectangular field, which we can call the world.  Each (x,y) location in the world can be thought of as a place that an individual occupies.  Sometimes this is called a cell; the cellular part of cellular automata.  An individual may be alive or dead.  The alive individuals make up a population.</p>
                <p>The world is created with a set number of rows and columns.  At construction, an individual is allocated for each (x,y) location.  Each individual also has a list of it's neighboring individuals, which we build after all the individuals have been created.  Each individual has 8 neighbors; think of a tick-tack-toe board with an 'o' in the middle and x's in all the other spots - the x's are the neighbors.  The neighbor lists are constructed in such a way that that the rectangular world is treated as a torus; the top edge in continuous with the bottom edge and the left edge is continuous with the right edge.   If we did not do this, then individuals at the edges would not have the same number of neighbors as the individuals in the center and so the rules for calculating the next generation would break down at the edges.</p>
                <aside>A torus looks like a donut or a bagel; see here TODO(add torus link).  Would you rather live on a donut or a begal?</aside>
                <h3>The Population</h3>
                <p>The most important part of Life is how it changes from generation to generation.  That is handled with a population.  A population is a list of living individuals in a world.  Initially, the program sets individuals into the population using their (x,y) position in the world.  After this initial population is created, the next generation can be calculation use the Population.nextGeneration() method.  That will apply the rules of Life to the current population to calculate the set of alive individuals.  In so doing, it also records which individuals from the current population survive survived from the previous generation, which died and which individuals were newly born into the new generation.</p>
                <aside>Although it is uncommon, a world can have more than one population.  The populations are distinct and do not interact.</aside>
                <h3>Drawing</h3>
                <p>Of course, we want to be able to watch all of these changes; that's the fun part.  To draw the population, we use a renderer. Formally, the renderer is an interface the separates the details of drawing from the details of the world, the population and the individuals.  This is an important part of the design; it allows the population to be drawn using any technology or library.  The drawing code simply implements the Renderer.renderIndividual(), then passes the renderer to Population.render() to render the entire Population.  Population.render() does two things; it first erases the previous generation, then draws the new generation.  If we continually loop, creating a new generation and drawing it on each iteration, then we can animate the evolution of the population.</p>

            <section id="algorithm">
                <h4>A Simple Way</h4>
                <p>A very straightforward way to implement the rules of life would be to visit each (x,y) location in the world and then, at each location, 'ask' all 8 neighbors if they are alive and apply the rules to figure out if that location is born, survives, or dies.  Let's think about how much work this is.  If we have a 10 x 10 world, then we have 100 locations.  So we visit each location, that is 100 locations, then at each location, we visit each heighbor, so that is another 8x100 or 800 locations.  So for a 100 location world, we make 900 location visits.  So the work is 9 time the number of locations.</p>
                <p>Let's think bigger; how about a 1000 x 1000 World.  That's 1,000,000 locations.  So, we know that we need to visit each location and it's 8 neighbors, so we will need to make 9,000,000 visits to create each generations.  As you can see, that is a lot of work.  That is especially problematic if you want to see the population animate as it evolves.  We are doing so much work to create the next generation that he animation will be very slow and unsatisfying.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>A Faster Way</h4>
                <p>The good news is that we can do a lot better than that by recognizing a couple of things.  First, only live individuals and their immediate neighbors are important in the next generation.  This is because the only way to stay alive or become alive is to have live neighbors, so the live individuals are the imporant ones.  Second, we can see that once Live progresses past the initial population, then the number of live invididuals is much smaller than the number of dead invididuals.  In fact, most of the world becomes a vast array of dead individuals and most of those dead individuals have only dead individuals for neighbors.  Because of the rules of Life, we know that a dead individual with all dead neighbors stays dead (there are no zombies in Conway's Life).  So the key to speeding up the evolution of the population is to focus on live individuals and their neighbors and ignore everything else.</p>
                <p>The algorithm that we will use does a couple things to speed things up.  First, we keep a list of live individuals and rather than visit every location we only visit live individuals and their direct neighbors. Next, rather than visit a location and 'asking' how many live neighbors does it have, we use the list of live individuals and then tell their neighbors they have a live neighbor.  The Invididual then keeps track of whether it shoudl be alive or dead as it's live neighbors check in.</p>
                <p>For each live individual, we visit it's 8 neighbors to tell each of them that they have a live neighbor.  The work we have to do is still 9xN, but now N is the number of live individuals, which is a small subset of the entire world.  Those locations that are not alive and have no live neighbors, which is most locations, are never visited; they take no work.</p>

                <h3>The Devil In the Details</h3>
                <p>The public api treats each location in the world as an (x,y) coordinate.  The Individual object at each (x,y) location does not need to be part of the public api.  In fact, it should not be part of the public API because that would allow users of the library to contruct Invididuals; there is no reason to construct Invididuals and it is potentially harmful, so we want to prevent it.  The problem is that the World class has a method called _getIndividualXY() that returns an Invidual.  That method is used by the Population class, so it needs to be visible withihn the library, but not visible to users of the library.  This was accomplished differently in TypeScript than in Dart.</p>
                <p>In Dart, it was as simple as making the Individual class hidden by prefixing it with an underscore. In Dart, this makes the class (or method or property) private to the library.  That is, it cannot be seen outside of the library, but it is visible to everything in the library.  This turned out to be perfect for my case.  Of course, each place that it is used needs to use the underscored name, but that is part of the Dart system that I have actually started to use in my other programming because it makes it clear at the point of usage that it is private.</p>
                <p> In TypeScript, I had to use a lot more code and the results are not entirely satisfactory.  TypeScript includes the ability to add a 'private' modifier to a class or method or property.  So my first attempt was to make both the Individual class and the _getIndividualXY() method private.  That did not compile because be when private is applied to a class method, the method become private to just that class and cannot be seen by the rest of the library.  There is currently not way to create a 'library' private method with TypeScript.  So, because _getIndividualXY() must be public, then it's return value, which is an Individual, must be public.  So the only other alternative was to make Individual so that it could not be constructed outside of the library.  I did this by creating a public interface type that exposed methods to get important values, but not to set them.  This exposed another weakness; Typescript does not allow get/set in interfaces.  What I wanted to do was to create an interface that says, "You can read the value of x, you can read the value of y, etc." and use getter syntax to implement that.  However, Typescript does not allow getter syntax in interfaces, so I was forced to implement these as functions.</p>

                <h4>Building the Typescript Version</h4>
                <p>Build with Typescript is easy.  We can run the typescript compiler in watch mode.  Whenever any of the typescript source files changes, the compiler will detect it and rebuild the javascript file that is used in the html file.  From within the life folder, run this command:</p>
                <p><kbd>tsc -w -t ES5 --sourcemap src/ts/main.ts --out src/js/life.ts.js</kbd></p>
                <aside>
                    <h5>Installing Nodejs</h5>
                    <p>Both the typescript compiler and the less compiler run using nodejs.  Nodejs is basically Google's V8 Javascript engine packaged to run command line scripts.  Once nodejs is installed, you can install node modules using NPM (commonly referred to as the Node Package Manager).  Nodejs can be installed directly from the project website at <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a>.</p>

                    <h5>Installing Typescript</h5>
                    <p>The typescript compiler runs in nodejs.  First, you need to install node, then you can run this command to install the Typescript compiler:</p>
                    <p><kbd>npm install -g typescript</kbd></p>

            <section>
                <h4>Building the Dart Version</h4>
                <p>The dart source code runs directly in the the Dartium browser because it has a native Dart VM.  The html file has a Javascript script that detects if the browser supports Dart natively and runs the dart files.  Of course, most browsers do not have a native Dart VM, but we can use the dart2js compiler to create equivalent Javascript.  From within the life folder, run this command:</p>
                <p><kbd>dart2js -m -o src/js/life.dart.js src/dart/main.dart</kbd></p>
                <aside>
                    <h5>Installing Dart SDK</h5>
                    <p>Dart comes with it's own IDE for editing and running dart code.  The IDE distribution also includes the Dart SDK, which includes the dart2js compiler.  You may also download the SDK without the IDE.  You can find instructions for both at <a href="https://www.dartlang.org/tools/sdk/" target="_blank">https://www.dartlang.org</a></p>

            <section>
                <h4>Compiling Less Files</h4>
                <p>Both the Typescript and the Dart versions share the same css file.  We are using less.js for generating our css files.  This is certainly overkill for this project, but part of my goal for this project was to create a build system that is generally useful for small and large projects.  At this point, I have no good solution for running less in 'watch' mode, so it needs to be run each time the life.less file is changed.  From within the life folder, run this command:</p>
                <p><kbd>lessc src/less/life.less src/css/life.css</kbd></p>
                <aside>
                    <h5>Installing Less</h5>
                    <p>The less compiler runs in nodejs.  First, you need to install node, then you can run this command to install the Less compiler:</p>
                    <p><kbd>npm install -g less</kbd></p>
                </aside>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h4>Running</h4>
                <p>We will run in a browser, but first we need to server the page.  I've installed a node script using NPM called http-server that runs a local server on port 8080.  From within the life folder, run this command:</p>
                <p><kbd>http-server src</kbd></p>
                <p>Now you can open a browser to <kbd>http://localhost:8080/life.ts.html</kbd> to view the typescript version and/or <kbd>http://localhost:8080/life.dart.html</kbd> to see the dart version.</p>
                    <h5>Installing http-server</h5>
                    <p>The http-server runs in nodejs.  First, you need to install node, then you can run this command to install  http-server:</p>
                    <p><kbd>npm install -g http-server</kbd></p>
